Still need to add Favicon
--done-- Figure out how to move the image to the right.

(Routing): Add a separate page. May be for Resume or Accomplishments. TBD.  
--done?-- I added a separate page.
[Quick Explanation: The Router will literally display the component exactly where '<Route>' is defined.
Currently, this means that the Navigation Bar will ALWAYS be there. Perhaps there is a better way. To be realized soon.]

--done-- Edit the transition animation upon scrolling to take the viewport position as a prop rather than what it crrently does.

Still need to finish the resume page.
